# My Senior Dev - Rules

Rules and workflows for building software with My Senior Dev.

## The 4-Step Workflow

**Test Stubs → Architecture → Object Design → Implementation**

Each step produces a separate, reviewable PR optimized for human code review.

## Key Principles

- Think before coding
- Small, reviewable PRs
- Quality gates at each step
- Documentation gathering for large features
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
